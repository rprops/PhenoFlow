# **WARNING:** 
**The active development of Phenoflow has been shifted [here](https://github.com/rprops/Phenoflow_package), as an R package. Some major changes have been made, so please use this version. You can download it as such:**
```R
install_github("rprops/Phenoflow_package")

<p align="justify">The goal of this method is to translate flow cytometry data, into diversity estimates of microbial communities, such as depicted below (data available at <a href="http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.m1c04"> doi:10.5061/dryad.m1c04 </a>), which can be compared with 16S rRNA gene amplicon data sets. </p>
